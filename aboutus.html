        About us!
    </h1>
    <br><br>
    <p> This website was created by four friends who agreed that the NJIT dining hall food should have ratings to determine which 
        foods are more appetizing. The goal is for all students, staff, and guests to rate the dining hall food, and over time, 
        the ratings will accumulate to show which foods are eaten and liked more than others. The ratings will help the staff 
        identify which dishes to prepare more frequently and which to make less often, reducing waste. They will also assist 
        students and guests in discovering what food they might potentially enjoy.
